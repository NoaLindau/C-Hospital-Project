# C-Hospital-Project
A program I have made during my studies of C. 
This program uses unsafe functions that do not support buffer overflow (scanf for example).
When using the program, please do not use spaces. For example, when running the exe, 3 to add a doctor, you will be asked for a name, simply write the first name. 
To safely exit when the program is stuck, press Ctrl+C.

Thank you.

This program replicates a hospital.
You can add doctors, listen their speciality and view all the doctors (2 and 3). You can also fire a doctor, which is option 6.
You can manage patients and view them(1 and 4). When you add a patient, you associate them to a doctor (please don't overwork them, I didn't add any checks for working hours).
You can also release a patient(option 5).

Have fun!
